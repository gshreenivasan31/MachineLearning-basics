Machine Learning – Learning Repository

This repository contains everything I learned from the  Machine Learning course.  
I typed, practiced, and implemented every concept to build a strong foundation in ML.

The purpose of this repo:
- Document my learning journey  
- Practice clean and understandable ML code  
- Build a reference for ML fundamentals  
- Prepare for real-world ML projects  

 Topics Covered 
 
 🔹 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values  
- Label encoding & one-hot encoding  
- Scaling & normalization  
- Train-test split  
- Feature engineering basics  

🔹 2. Regression Algorithms
- Linear Regression  
- Gradient Descent  
- Cost function & optimization  
- Multivariate regression  
- Regularization (Ridge & Lasso)  

🔹 3. Classification Algorithms
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Trees  
- k-Nearest Neighbors  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Naive Bayes  

 🔹 4. Model Evaluation
- Accuracy, precision, recall  
- Confusion matrix  
- ROC, AUC  
- Cross-validation  

 🔹 5. End-to-End ML Projects
- Data cleaning  
- Exploratory analysis
